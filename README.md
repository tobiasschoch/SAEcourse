### 2.1 Data

The dataset is stored as R code. Therefore, we `source` the dataset instead of loading it. In your R session, call `source("data.R")`.

### 2.2 Methods – functions

I have written some tiny auxiliary functions that may be helpful when working with the `sae` package. In your R session, call `source("methods.R")`.

### 2.3 Code snippets used in the slides

The file `snippets.R` contains the R code that I used in my slides.

### 2.4 Application – Sandbox

The file `application.md`  contains some exercises and applications.
