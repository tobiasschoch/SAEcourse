# Short Course on Small Area Estimation 

In this course, I focus primarily on the area-level model (Fay-Herriot model). The unit-level model is 

## Data

The dataset is stored as R code. Therefore, we `source` the dataset instead of loading it.

```r
source("data.R")
```

## Methods

I have written some tiny auxiliary functions that may be helpful when working with the `sae` package. 

```R
source("methods.R")
```

## Code snippets used in the slides

The file `snippets.R` contains the R code that I used in my slides.

## Application – Sandbox

The file `application.md`  contains some exercises and applications.
